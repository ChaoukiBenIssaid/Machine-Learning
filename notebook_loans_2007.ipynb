    "Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. Each borrower fills out a comprehensive application, providing his past financial history, the reason for the loan, etc. Each borrower's credit score is then evaluated using past historical data and an interest rate is assinged to the borrower. In this task, we'll focus on approved loans data from 2007 to 2011."
